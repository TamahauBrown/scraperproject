            - https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cics-ts/5.2?topic=concepts-components-url 
            - HTTP URLs are normally made up of 4 components:
                - a scheme: (ex: HTTP) defines the protocol used to access the resource attached to the URL
                - host: the name of the server who "hosts" the resource (ex: Google.com)
                - path: the specific resource on the host server the URL is accessing
                - query string: (comes after path) usually includes a string pair of 'name' and 'value', separated by an ampersand '&'

        - "REs"
