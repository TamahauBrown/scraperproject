&#x200B;

To show SE support, I think we need to uninstall the following mods:  
\- u/OlivinePeridot

\- u/Angelicel 

\- u/KupoBot

\- u/AutoModerator

This suggestion was made by me in mind for the betterment of this sub one hundred percent and not at all because I don't want to get banned for using racial slurs against the lalafell.

56,I decided to transcribe all of the voiced Dragonspeak in The Aery just to see if it was actually coherent dialogue,"**Heavensward spoilers!**


With DSU going on, a lot of people have been cracking jokes about how one of Nidhogg's voice lines sounds like ""I am named Kyle."" Out of curiosity, I decided to see if I could translate it, and it turns out you can! Using [these](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/265527) [two](https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/265400) forum posts by the person responsible for creating the language, you can translate the line to *""Ahm in lhein fhail"",* or ""Thy final verse is sung.""


Now, according to one of said posts, all voice acted Dragonspeak (Nidhogg, Tiamat and Hraesvelgr's dialogue) begins in Japanese, is translated to English, translated to dragon, and then read out loud by the language's creator so the voice actors know what to say. But surely, I thought, there's no way it's ALL real words? Right? They wouldn't go through all that effort when nobody would be able to tell the difference anyway, would they?


So I decided to use the Aery as a test to see if everything Nidhogg says is coherent, and it turns out that yes, they *would* in fact go through all that effort lmao. All of it lines up with the established rules and definitions perfectly, though the English lines in-game occasionally differ from the line in Dragonspeak. Below, I've listed every line Nidhogg says throughout the dungeon, when he says it, and the English dialogue given + a more literal translation *if* I feel it doesn't quite match for whatever reason. Without further ado:


**The Aery opening cutscene, shortly after Estinien flashes Nidhogg with the eye:**


>*""Errn eil! Sekh a nesh seh anoh ahs an!""*

(Wicked mortals! I shall melt thy flesh and see thy bones ash!)


**Final boss, upon casting The Scarlet Price:**


>*""Shah na!""*

(The given line is ""Tremble before my fury!"", however the word *na* is used to emphasize a phrase as a command, while *shah* means to tremble or shake. So a more literal translation would simply be ""Tremble!"")


**Final boss, halfway through casting Massacre:**


>*""N sjahs an!""*

(The given line is simply ""Vengeance!"", however *N* means *be* while *An* implies ownership by Nidhogg. In other words, ""Be mine, vengeance!"" or ""Vengeance is mine!"")


**Upon casting Massacre:**


>*""Soohs an ghar in!""* 

(The provided line is ""My rage will consume you!"".  However, the closest word to consume in dragonspeak is *eehs,* while the line clearly has an *""oo""* sound. I'm not 100% confident in this one, but I believe the more literal translation would be something to the effect of ""I shall wield my rage against you"". As *oohs* means to use or wield something, while the added *s* at the beginning implies will or shall.)


**Post-boss cutscene, Nidhogg attempts to divebomb the WoL but is interrupted by Estinien flashing him a second time, crash landing.**


>*""Soohs an hessnesh ool an eiln in!? Nehk Nell y ahim!""*

(Thou wouldst use mine own eye against me? Time hath done naught to dilute thy kind's depravity!)
(Note: *Nell* specifically refers to the Elezen).


>*""No doh in y drahorh an. Seeth in an esh...seeth khei!""*

(I have not forgotten thee, dragoon! Mine essence claimed thee once...and shall do so again!)
(Second sentence is more literally: ""You held my spirit once...now hold it again!"" *Held* could be interchangeable with something like *housed,* in this case.)


I've always found fictional languages in video games very interesting, especially if the words mean actual things instead of just being gibberish that's meant to sound alien. Studying these lines was a lot of fun, though a tad bit annoying at times because Nidhogg's reverb can cause certain sounds to blend together. If people are as interested in the subject as I am, I could probably do this again with the rest of his dialogue and/or Hraesvelgr + Tiamat.",uzc60n,2945,136,https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/uzc60n/i_decided_to_transcribe_all_of_the_voiced/
